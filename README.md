This repository is created to store all WQD7005 Alternative Assessment 1 Case Study on E-Commerce

### Project Overview
This Case Study is being conducted to assess customer behaviour based on the shopping habits from e-commerce website which encompassing various customer attributes and purchase history over the years. The objective of this assessment is to gain customer insights as well as establish focused strategy to increase the subscription status rate by intepretating the predictive model results based on customer preferences and behaviors that drive the subscriptions. The result and insights shown in the assesment can be used by the business (end user) to develop targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer engagement initiatives.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset that has been used for the assessment is obtained from Kaggle titled “Customer Behaviour and Shopping Habits Dataset” (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset) which consists of  3,900 purchases with 18 attributes that similar to the dataset structure proposed for the assessment. 

It is to be noted all the required dataset structure from the assessment is available except 'LastPurchaseDate' however similar attributes to encounter this variable is available i.e. "Previous Purchases": Provides information on the number or frequency of prior purchases made by the customer, contributing to customer segmentation and retention strategies and "Frequency of Purchases"

For the "Memrbership Level" variable, initial data structure has no membership level however the dataset is being modified such a way that it meets the required data structure based on Subscription Status and Frequency of Purchase

### Tools for E-Commerce Dataset
#### 1. SAS Enterprise Miner


#### 2. Talend Data Preparation
Talend Data Preparation is a data cleaning and transformation tool that allows users to prepare for datamining project. This tool provides a user-friendly, web-based interface that enables data workers to access, cleanse, enrich, and transform data with features like filtering, sorting, standardisation, deduplication, and merging datasets. Users can also standardize data by applying various functions to correct, format, and enrich data, ensuring that it is ready for use in analytics, reporting, or integration tasks.

For this project, the e-commerce will be preprocessed and cleansed using Talend Data Preparation especially to quickly understand the data in terms of missing values, data quality as well as data understanding from the visualisation
